Auckland Moto Parking is a must have app for every motorcyclist in the Auckland region. The simple map shows you almost all publically available motorcycle parking areas within the Auckland CBD.

You can view more details about a particular space, and also navigate to it from your location using Google Maps.

I will try to keep the map constantly updated with new information - if you would like to contribute to the map, please email support@appavate.com with parking details/updates.

Permissions Required:
- Internet: To show the map and ads;
